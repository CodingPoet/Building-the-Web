  Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

  In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages. 

  After morning tea we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We'll look at the files that run a website and how to make them display what we want.

  After lunch we will add some fancy extras to our site, like some fancy fonts and an interactive gallery. Then we will publish our sites so we can share them with our friends.
