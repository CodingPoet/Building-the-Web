## HTML Head

Every web page should have a `head` section.

    <!-- head only used by the browser -->
    <head>
        <title>My Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>

The `title` is the text which shows up in your browser's tab bar.

Change `My Page Title` to something else like `My Awesome Site`.
