## Self-closing Elements

Self-closing elements have no closing tag - only an opening tag.

Here is the code for **horizontal rule**, **line break**, and **image**:

    <hr>

    <br>

    <img src="http://gathergather.co.nz/grumpy-cat.png">

The image tag requires the `src` attribute, which stands for "source". <br>
The `src` is a URL for an image on the Internet.

Note:

So we've learned about tag pairs. Most HTML tags are like that, but we also have some special cases.

These special cases are tags which only need an opening tag, no closing tag.
